## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

I am a senior engineer at the IT Algorithm Department of the Huawei Technologies CO., LTD., Hangzhou, China.

## Research Interest

My research mainly focuses on Evolutionary Computation (EC) and its Applications. As one of the main complementary techniques, EC is widely acknowledged as a family of powerful tools for non-differentiable complex optimization problems that mathematical methods or gradient based approaches are ill-equiped to deal with. Currently, I am particularly intersted in EC-based approaches on:

1. Large-scale optimization problems
2. Multi-modal optimization problems
3. QoS in cloud computing

## Publications

1. F.Bar, J.Doe: Effects of having a placeholder of a name
2. S.Holmes, J.Watson: Consequences of living with a sociopath in London
